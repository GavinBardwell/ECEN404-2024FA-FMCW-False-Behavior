This is the capstone project for the Texas A&M ECEN class. Sponsored by Sandia National Laboratory and is titled FMCW False Behavior.
In this project we created a simulation, application, and python scripts to run FMCW radars in real life and in matlab sims.
This is the file structure


RadarSim -> legacy code from first semester containing a base script for simulation
RadarApp -> application for simulation of FMCW radars
FalseBehavior -> python script for false bevaior detection and binary reader for AWR2944EVM by TI
