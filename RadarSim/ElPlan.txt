Plan for FMCW sim

1) waveform generation
	a) victim waveform function
	b) attacker waveform function
2) show results
	a) show distance measurements
	b) make a good gui interface
3) allow for editing
	a) currently allow for one axis(distance)
		b) stretch goal would be to add both benign and hostile objects(would mean adding second or third axis)
